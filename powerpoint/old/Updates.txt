Pathways or possible mechinisims that are convergining in cimp
WENT pathway for CIMP

Background slide

Hypothisis:
What is cimp, and how does it work
What are the effects of cimp on the operation of the genome

Contrast agiants the normal cells

There are already muations that corrilate with cimp

How do mutations relate to DNA methilation


Are there multiple mechinisums or paths to reach CIMP+

How does the Uterine cancer relate to other cancer types. i.e. Colorectal
Do the CIMP positive samples use the same mechinisums?
If the mutations converge on the same pathways

Is CIMP a function of DNA repare processes

C. Repeat the process for CIMP+ subgroups

add more details to AIM 3



Compare cromitine modifying genes
Layout in plainterms the goal of the forests

Exploration in removing features that are not important
itteravly each week refine approcuh in result for only things we want to keep
8000 + features boil it down to only important features

Maybe first elemenate that doesnt have CIMP+

What can we just remove immediatly,
Ways in order to uncover all data

All mutations that are related to CIMP+
	Related in somehow apart of the disease
	

Using CIMP+ samples it is possible to discover mutations if they exsist
There may be mutations that strongly corrilate to the CIMP+ condition
